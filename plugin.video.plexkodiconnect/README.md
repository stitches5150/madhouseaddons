# PlexKodiConnect (PKC)
**Combine the best frontend media player Kodi with the best multimedia backend server Plex**

PKC synchronizes your media from your Plex server to the native Kodi database. Hence:
- Use virtually any other Kodi add-on
- Use any Kodi skin, completely customize Kodi's look
- Browse your media very fluently (cached artwork)
- Automatically get additional artwork (more than Plex offers)
- Use Plex features with a Kodi interface

Have a look at [some screenshots](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Some-PKC-Screenshots) to see what's possible. 

### Update Your PKC Repo to Receive Updates!

Unfortunately, the PKC Kodi repository had to move because it stopped working (thanks https://bintray.com). If you installed PKC before December 15, 2017, you need to [**MANUALLY** update the repo once](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Update-PKC-Repository).

### Download and Installation

Install PKC via the PlexKodiConnect Kodi repository download button just below (do NOT use the standard GitHub download!). See the [github wiki installation manual](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Installation) for a detailed guide. Please use the stable version except if you really know what you're doing. Kodi will update PKC automatically. 

| Stable version | Beta version |
|----------------|--------------|
| [![stable version](https://img.shields.io/badge/stable_version-latest-blue.svg?maxAge=60&style=flat) ](https://github.com/croneter/binary_repo/raw/master/stable/repository.plexkodiconnect/repository.plexkodiconnect-1.0.2.zip)  | [![beta version](https://img.shields.io/badge/beta_version-latest-red.svg?maxAge=60&style=flat) ](https://github.com/croneter/binary_repo/raw/master/beta/repository.plexkodiconnectbeta/repository.plexkodiconnectbeta-1.0.2.zip) |

### Warning
Use at your own risk! This plugin assumes that you manage all your videos with Plex (and none with Kodi). You might lose data already stored in the Kodi video and music databases as this plugin directly changes them. Don't worry if you want Plex to manage all your media (like you should ;-)). 

Some people argue that PKC is 'hacky' because of the way it directly accesses the Kodi database. See [here for a more thorough discussion](https://github.com/croneter/PlexKodiConnect/wiki/Is-PKC-'hacky'%3F).

- PlexKodiConnect shamelessly uses pretty much all the code of "Emby for Kodi" by the awesome Emby team (see https://github.com/MediaBrowser/plugin.video.emby). Thanks for sharing guys!!
- Plex Companion ("PlexBMC Helper") and other stuff were adapted from @Hippojay 's great work (see https://github.com/hippojay).
- The foundation of the Plex API is all iBaa's work (https://github.com/iBaa/PlexConnect).
